Because these files are large, processing them takes longer, resulting in a bottleneck. We have an average of 100 million records. This is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. We used to have a large codebase that read the file, processed it, and then uploaded it in bulk to elastic search, which took 5-7 days. I didn't like how tedious and labor-intensive this operation was, so we decided to create a Fully Automated Pipeline that could load all of this data in a fraction of the time.
